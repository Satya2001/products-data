  description: Cement grouting is a slurry that is placed as a flowable liquid. It
    is an effective material for filling and strengthening granular soils, voids in
    rocks, foundation underpinnings, and other underground voids. Also called structural
    grout, these materials typically impart significant compressive strength to the
    system.

  \ aggregate (ASTM C33), Portland cement (ASTM C150), slag cement (ASTM C989), fly\
  \ ash (ASTM C618), batch water (ASTM C1602), admixture (ASTM C494)\n\n## LCA Notes\n\
  LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT This EPD is based on a \u2018cradle-to-gate\u2019 life cycle\
  \ assessment (LCA) of ready mixed concrete mixes. A summary of life cycle processes\
  \ included in the EPD is as follows: Raw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction,\
  \ handling, and processing of the raw materials used in production of concrete:\
  \ cement, supplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water,\
  \ admixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures. Transportation:\
  \ Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate of the concrete producer.\
  \ Manufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and distribute\
  \ the concrete and operate the facility (concrete plant). Water use in mixing and\
  \ distributing concrete. A summary of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded\
  \ from the EPD is as follows: Production, manufacture, and construction of buildings,\
  \ capital goods, and infrastructure. Production and manufacture of concrete production\
  \ equipment, concrete delivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\
  \ Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies). Energy and\
  \ water use related to company management and sales activities. A summary of the\
  \ limitations of this EPD include the following: This EPD does not report all of\
  \ the environmental impacts due to manufacturing of the product, but rather environmental\
  \ impacts for categories with established LCA-based methods to track and report.\
  \ Unreported environmental impacts include (but are not limited to) factors attributable\
  \ to human health, land use change, water use in the upstream manufacturing process,\
  \ and habitat destruction. This EPD reports the results of an LCA for \u2018cradle-to-gate\u2019\
  \ analysis. Thus, declarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined\
  \ as an environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\
  \ versus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does not make\
  \ any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or worse than any\
  \ other product. In order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing,\
  \ additional analysis is required. Life cycle impact assessment results are relative\
  \ expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of\
  \ thresholds, safety margins, or risks. Note: The product manufacturer has the option\
  \ of declaring additional information about their product including conformance\
  \ with any other sustainability certification programs that often have performance\
  \ and prescriptive requirements that aim to illustrate environmental best practices\
  \ that cannot be captured by LCA.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland\
