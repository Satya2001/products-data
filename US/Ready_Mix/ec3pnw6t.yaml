lca_discussion: "\n\n## Product Component Notes\ncrushed aggregate (ASTM C33), Portland\
  \ cement (ASTM C150), fly ash (ASTM C618), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM\
  \ C1602)\n\n## LCA Notes\nTransportation: Transportation of these materials from\
  \ supplier to the gate of the concrete producer. Manufacturing (core processes):\
  \ Energy used to store, batch, mix, and distribute the concrete and operate the\
  \ facility (concrete plant). Water use in mixing and distributing concrete. A summary\
  \ of cradle-to-gate life cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as follows: Production,\
  \ manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital goods, and infrastructure.\
  \ Production and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete delivery\
  \ vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment. Personnel-related activities\
  \ (travel, furniture, office supplies). Energy and water use related to company\
  \ management and sales activities. A summary of the limitations of this EPD include\
  \ the following: This EPD does not report all of the environmental impacts due to\
  \ manufacturing of the product, but rather environmental impacts for categories\
  \ with established LCA-based methods to track and report. Unreported environmental\
  \ impacts include (but are not limited to) factors attributable to human health,\
  \ land use change, water use in the upstream manufacturing process, and habitat\
  \ destruction. This EPD reports the results of an LCA for \u2018cradle-to-gate\u2019\
  \ analysis. Thus, declarations themselves are not comparative assertions, defined\
  \ as an environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product\
  \ versus a competing product that performs the same function. An EPD does not make\
  \ any statements that the product covered by the EPD is better or worse than any\
  \ other product. In order to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing,\
  \ additional analysis is required. Life cycle impact assessment results are relative\
  \ expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of\
  \ thresholds, safety margins, or risks. Note: The product manufacturer has the option\
  \ of declaring additional information about their product including conformance\
  \ with any other sustainability certification programs that often have performance\
  \ and prescriptive requirements that aim to illustrate environmental best practices\
  \ that cannot be captured by LCA. Data quality, variability, and comparability This\
  \ EPD was created using plant-specific data for upstream materials. Potential variations\
  \ due to supplier locations, manufacturing processes, and efficiencies and fuel\
  \ use are thus accounted for in this EPD. EPDs of concrete mixtures may not be comparable\
  \ if they do not comply with this standard and data from this EPD. While EPDs can\
  \ be used to compare concrete mixes, the data cannot be used to compare between\
  \ construction products or concrete mixes used in different concrete products unless\
  \ the data is integrated into a comprehensive LCA. For example, precast concrete,\
  \ concrete masonry units, and site-cast concrete all have different manufacturing\
  \ processes whose impacts are attributed to different LCA stages. This precludes\
  \ direct comparison between mixes used in these different products until all life\
  \ cycle phases are included.\n\n## Source Data Notes\nPortland cement: Portland\
