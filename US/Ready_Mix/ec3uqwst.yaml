  \n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT This EPD is based ona \u2018cradle-to-gate\u2019\
  life cycle assessment(LCA) of ready mixe concrete mixes. Asummary of life cycle\
  \ processesincluded in the EPD is as follows: e Raw material supply (upstream processes):\
  \ Extraction, handling, and processing of the raw materials used in production of\
  \ concrete: cement, supplementary cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and\
  \ fine), water admixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures.\
  \ e Transportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to the gate\
  \ of the concrete producer. e Manufacturing (core processes): Energy used to store,\
  \ batch, mix, and distribute the concrete and operatethe facility (concrete plant).\
  \ e Water use in mixing and distributing concrete. Asummary of cradle-to-gatelife\
  \ cycle processes excluded from the EPD is as follows: e Production, manufacture,\
  \ and construction of buildings, capital goods, and infrastructure. e Production\
  \ and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete delivery vehicles,\
  \ earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment. e Personnel-related activities\
  \ (travel, furniture, office supplies). e Energyand water use related to company\
  \ managementandsalesactivitie Asummary ofthe limitations of this EPD include thefollowing:\
  \ e This EPD doesnotreport all of the environmental impacts due to manufacturingof\
  \ the product, but rather environmental impacts for categories with established\
  \ LCA-based methods to track andreport. Unreported environmental impacts include\
  \ (but are notlimited to) factors attributable to human health, land use change,\
  \ water use in the upstream manufacturing process, and habitat destruction. e This\
  \ EPD reports the results of an LCAfor \u2018cradle-to-gate\u2019 analysis. Thus,\
  \ declarations themselvesare not comparative assertions, defined as an environmental\
  \ claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one produc versus a competing\
  \ product that performs the samefunction. An EPD doe not makeany statements that\
  \ the product covered by the EPDis better or worse than any other product. e Inorder\
  \ to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional analysis is required.\
  \ e Life cycle impact assessmentresults are relative expressions and do not predict\
  \ impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds, safety margins, or\
  \ risks. Note: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring additional information\
  \ abouttheir product including conformance with anyother sustainability certificatio\
  \ programs that often have performance andprescriptive requirements that aim to\
  \ illustrate environmental best practices that cannot be captured by LCA DATA QUALITY,\
  \ VARIABILITY, AND COMPARABILITY\n\n## Source Data Notes\ne Admixture (plasticizing):\
