description: "Central Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit\

  \ for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification\
  \ Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life\
  \ cycle stages not included in this EPD: \u2022 A4: Transportation to the construction\
  \ site \u2022 A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) \u2022\
  \ B1-7: Building use and maintenance \u2022 C1-4: End of life This information can\
  \ be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products\
  \ that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast\
  \ concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided\
  \ the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted\
  \ for and the information is integrated into a comprehensive LCA."

  ## Product Component Notes

  The components of the mixes included in this EPD meet the following standards: Component
  Standard Portland cement ASTM C150 Standard Specification for Portland Cement Fly
  ash ASTM C618 Standard Specification for Coal Fly Ash and Raw or Calcined Natural
  Pozzolan for Use in Concrete Slag cement ASTM C989 Standard Specification for Slag
  Cement for Use in Concrete and Mortars Natural and crushed ASTM C33 Standard Specification
  for Concrete aggregates Aggregates Admixtures ASTM C494 Standard Specification for
  Chemical Admixtures for Concrete Batch water ASTM C1602 Standard Specification for
  Mixing Water Used in the Production of Hydraulic Cement Concrete


  ## LCA Notes

  A summary of life cycle processes included in the EPD is as follows: 1. Raw material
  supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling, and processing of the raw materials
  used in production of concrete: cement, supplementary cementitious materials, aggregate
  (coarse and fine), water, admixtures, and other materials or chemicals used in concrete
  mixtures. 2. Transportation: Transportation of these materials from supplier to
  the gate of the concrete producer. 3. Manufacturing (core processes): Energy used
  to store, batch, mix, and distribute the concrete and operate the facility (concrete
  plant). 4. Water use in mixing and distributing concrete. A summary of life cycle
  processes excluded from the EPD is as follows: 1. Production, manufacture, and construction
  of buildings, capital goods, and infrastructure with an expected lifespan of over
  five years. 2. Production and manufacture of concrete production equipment, concrete
  delivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment with expected
  lifespan of over five years. 3. Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture,
  office supplies). 4. Energy and water use related to company management and sales
  activities. 5. Water use in upstream manufacturing processes and in placement and
  curing of concrete. Better data and methodology is required to track and report
  these numbers.
