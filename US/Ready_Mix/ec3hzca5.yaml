  \ ash (ASTM C618), admixture (ASTM C494), batch water (ASTM C1602) es (PCR)for ISO\
  \ 14025 TypeIll Environmental Product Declarations\n\n## LCA Notes\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT\
  \ This EPD is based ona \u2018cradle-to-gate\u2019life cycle assessment(LCA) of\
  \ ready mixe concrete mixes. Asummary of life cycle processesincluded in the EPD\
  \ is as follows: e Raw material supply (upstream processes): Extraction, handling,\
  \ and processing of the raw materials used in production of concrete: cement, supplementary\
  \ cementitious materials, aggregate (coarse and fine), water admixtures, and other\
  \ materials or chemicals used in concrete mixtures. e Transportation: Transportation\
  \ of these materials from supplier to the gate of the concrete producer. e Manufacturing\
  \ (core processes): Energy used to store, batch, mix, and distribute the concrete\
  \ and operatethe facility (concrete plant). e Water use in mixing and distributing\
  \ concrete. Asummary of cradle-to-gatelife cycle processes excluded from the EPD\
  \ is as follows: e Production, manufacture, and construction of buildings, capital\
  \ goods, and infrastructure. e Production and manufacture of concrete production\
  \ equipment, concrete delivery vehicles, earthmoving equipment, and laboratory equipment.\
  \ e Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies). e Energyand\
  \ water use related to company managementandsalesactivitie Asummary ofthe limitations\
  \ of this EPD include thefollowing: e This EPD doesnotreport all of the environmental\
  \ impacts due to manufacturingof the product, but rather environmental impacts for\
  \ categories with established LCA-based methods to track andreport. Unreported environmental\
  \ impacts include (but are notlimited to) factors attributable to human health,\
  \ land use change, water use in the upstream manufacturing process, and habitat\
  \ destruction. e This EPD reports the results of an LCAfor \u2018cradle-to-gate\u2019\
  \ analysis. Thus, declarations themselvesare not comparative assertions, defined\
  \ as an environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one produc\
  \ versus a competing product that performs the samefunction. An EPD doe not makeany\
  \ statements that the product covered by the EPDis better or worse than any other\
  \ product. e Inorder to assess the local impacts of product manufacturing, additional\
  \ analysis is required. e Life cycle impact assessmentresults are relative expressions\
  \ and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds,\
  \ safety margins, or risks. Note: The product manufacturer has the option of declaring\
  \ additional information abouttheir product including conformance with anyother\
  \ sustainability certificatio programs that often have performance andprescriptive\
  \ requirements that aim to illustrate environmental best practices that cannot be\
  \ captured by LCA DATA QUALITY, VARIABILITY, AND COMPARABILITY\n\n## Source Data\
