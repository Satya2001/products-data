description: Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a large-scale, prefabricated, solid engineered
  wood panel. Lightweight yet very strong, with superior acoustic, fire, seismic,
  and thermal performance, CLT is also fast and easy to install, generating almost
  no waste onsite. CLT offers design flexibility and low environmental impacts.A CLT
  panel consists of several layers of kiln-dried lumber boards stacked in alternating
  directions, bonded with structural adhesives, and pressed to form a solid, straight,
  rectangular panel. CLT panels consist of an odd number of layers (usually, three
  to seven,) and may be sanded or prefinished before shipping. Finished CLT panels
  are exceptionally stiff, strong, and stable, handling load transfer on all sides.
