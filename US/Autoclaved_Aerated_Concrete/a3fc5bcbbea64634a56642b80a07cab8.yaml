  ## LCA Notes

  Product Description

  The Superlite 8x8x16 normal weight concrete masonry units

  represented by this cradle-to-gate EPD are produced at two plants

  in Arizona: West Phoenix (4601 N. 42nd Avenue Phoenix, AZ

  85019) and Superlite Block (2200 W. Gardner Lane Tucson, AZ

  85705) under ASTM C-90 specification for Loadbearing Concrete

  Masonry Units. The Concrete Masonry Units are used in a wide

  variety of low-rise buildings from residential to educational to

  commercial.


  Declared Unit

  The ASTM PCR for concrete and concrete masonry products only covers the cradle-to-gate

  life-cycle stages. Therefore, the declared unit for this EPD is one (1) m 3 of concrete
  formed

  into manufactured concrete and concrete masonry products. The EPD may be presented

  additionally per one (1) yd3 of concrete. This EPD covers only the cradle-to-gate
  impacts of

  manufactured concrete and concrete masonry products using a declared unit, and the

  results cannot be used to compare between products.


  System Boundaries

  Based on the ASTM PCR, the system boundaries are defined as the modules for raw

  material supply, transportation of inbound materials and the manufacturing process
  also

  known as the Product Stage. The stages include extraction and processing of raw

  materials (raw material supply), the average or specific transportation of raw materials
  from

  extraction site or source to the manufacturing site including empty backhauls (transportation

  of inbound materials) and the manufacturing of the product including the batching
  and

  mixing of the concrete, forming of the units, curing of the units and the applicable
  postproduction finishing of the units which includes the packaging with associated
  transportation

  and waste disposal in preparing the product for shipment. (Manufacturing process).


  Waste Management

  Hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated within the system boundaries and

  transported outside of the plant facility are reported in the EPD per declared unit.


  Certification Other Standards/Additional Testing Requirements

  Each product presented in this EPD conforms to the appropriate ASTM and/or CSA

  specification which provide detailed descriptions and specifications for each of
  the products.


  Allocation Rules

  A production process that generates more than one type of product may require the

  allocation of environmental flows from the process to the different products to
  get product-
