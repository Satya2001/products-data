  ## LCA Notes

  Product Description

  The RCP Block & Brick 8x8x16 splitface concrete masonry units

  represented by this cradle-to-gate EPD are produced at one plant

  located in San Diego, California under ASTM C-90 and

  ASTM C-129 specifications for loadbearing and non-loadbearing

  concrete masonry units. The concrete masonry units are used in a

  wide variety of masonry structures.


  Declared Unit

  The ASTM PCR for concrete and concrete masonry products only covers the cradle-to-gate

  life-cycle stages. Therefore, the declared unit for this EPD is one (1) yd3 of concrete

  formed into manufactured concrete and concrete masonry products. The EPD may be

  presented additionally per one (1) yd3 of concrete. This EPD covers only the cradle-to-gate

  impacts of manufactured concrete and concrete masonry products using a declared
  unit,

  and the results cannot be used to compare between products.


  System Boundaries

  Based on the ASTM PCR, the system boundaries are defined as the modules for raw

  material supply, transportation of inbound materials and the manufacturing process
  also

  known as the Product Stage. The stages include extraction and processing of raw

  materials (raw material supply), the average or specific transportation of raw materials
  from

  extraction site or source to the manufacturing site including empty backhauls

  (transportation of inbound materials) and the manufacturing of the product including
  the

  batching and mixing of the concrete, forming of the units, curing of the untis and
  the

  applicable post-production finishing of the units which includes the packaging with

  associated transportation and waste disposal in preparing the product for shipment.

  (manufacturing process).


  Waste Management

  Hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated within the system boundaries and

  transported outside of the plant facility are reported in the EPD per declared unit.


  Certification Other Standards/Additional Testing Requirements

  Each product presented in this EPD conforms to the appropriate ASTM and/or CSA

  specification which provide detailed descriptions and specifications for each of
  the

  products.


  Allocation Rules

  A production process that generates more than one type of product may require the

  allocation of environmental flows from the process to the different products to
  get product-
