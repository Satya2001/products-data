description: This Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) report pertains to a solution
  dyed Masland styrene butadiene latex backed broadloom carpet. This is an update
  to a previous EPD report (2014) to account for improvements to the carpet architecture.
  Masland is located at 716 Bill Myles Drive, Saraland, AL, 36571. The carpet has
  a face fiber weight of 28.9 oz/square yard (sy) (0.98 kg/m2) and a total weight
  of 66.8 oz/sy (2.27 kg/m2). The face fiber is composed of solution dyed nylon 6,6,
  and it is tufted on a primary backing made from polypropylene (PP). There is a secondary
  backing sheet of PP, and back coatings are styrene butadiene latex (SBL) with calcium
  carbonate as filler. The 2018 carpet has the same nylon 6,6 face fiber and PP backing
  weights as the 2014 carpet. Improvements come in the form of a reduced quantity
  of SBL, and replacement of aluminum hydroxide with calcium carbonate.

  \ and limestone). It can be ground to varying particle sizes and is widely used\

  \ (raw material acquisition) stage The life cycle assessment stage for sourcing\

  \ its source and ends at the receipt of the raw material at the carpet manufacturing\
  \ facility. All raw materials are evaluated for quality, availability, consistency,\
  \ performance, and value before acceptance into the manufacturing process. Once\
  \ the material and its source have passed the initial evaluation process, on-going\
  \ evaluation is made using the suppliers\u2019 certificate of analysis. Manufacturing\
  \ stage The production process is designed for efficiency, utilizing the strengths\
  \ of Masland\u2019s technology and expertise. It begins with the use of solution\
  \ dyed fibers. A change to the use of solution dyed nylon was made as a method of\
  \ reducing water and energy usage. The fiber is then converted into yarn in the\
  \ spinning process. About 90% of the nylon fiber is processed (twisted, heat set,\
  \ and warped) on site. The remainder of the fiber is processed by a supplier and\
  \ purchased in the warped state ready for tufting. These processes utilize water,\
  \ electricity, and natural gas. The tufting process incorporates tufting machines\
  \ that utilize needles to insert the yarn into a synthetic backing material. The\
  \ needles are controlled to determine the myriad of aesthetics that the marketplace\
  \ desires. This process requires electricity. Next is the coating process which\
  \ applies a high performance precoat to the back of the tufted substrate. This precoat\
  \ locks the fibers into place giving strength to the material. Following the precoat\
  \ process, the back coating consisting of SBR latex and a polypropylene backing\
  \ is added. The coating process uses electricity, gas, and water. Dyeing Spinning\
