description: "FOAMGLAS\xAE is an insulating material made of foamed glass for building\
  \ construction and industrial installations. It is used to manufacture dimensionallyaccurate\
  \ slabs, boards, pipe shells, segments and other special elements. FOAMGLAS\xAE\
  \ slabs and elements are largely manufactured from high-quality recycled glass (e.g.\
  \ windscreens) and mineral base materials such as sand and without the use of binding\
  \ agents. They display a closed-cell structure. The product FOAMGLAS\xAE\uFFFDF\
  \ is declared with a gross density of 165 kg/m\xB3 (\xB1 15 %). The products are\
  \ supplied in thicknesses of 40 mm to 160 mm, e.g. as slabs with high compressive\
  \ strength. The use of coated or uncoated FOAMGLAS\xAE is application-dependent.\
  \ The uncoated slab is frequently used for interior insulation, and then coated\
  \ with various types of plaster. For roofs, FOAMGLAS\xAE is either coated with hot\
  \ bitumen before the waterproofing membranes are applied, or special boards are\
  \ used, for example FOAMGLAS\xAE READY BOARD. This ex-works coating 2 is a thin\
  \ bitumen coating combined with foil or nonwoven fabric. The products by Pittsburgh\
  \ Corning Europe NV are produced in the Tessenderlo plant (Belgium)."

lca_discussion: "\n\n## Product Component Notes\nDeclared unit 1 kg Gross density\
  \ 165 kg/m3 3.2 System boundary Type of EPD: cradle to gate The LCA addresses the\
  \ life cycle stage of production. The product stage comprises Modules A1 (Raw material\
  \ supply), A2 (Transport) and A3 (Production). The following individual processes\
  \ were included in the product stage A1-A3 of production: \xB7 Processes for providing\
  \ preliminary products and energy \xB7 Transporting the raw materials and preliminary\
  \ materials to the plant \xB7 Manufacturing process in the plant including energy-\
  \ related expenses, disposal of residual materials and emissions \xB7 Production\
  \ of packaging The packaging material volumes considered involve annual consumption\
  \ / annual purchase volumes. Module A4 takes account of transportation to the construction\
  \ site. The utilisation of the packaging materials is assigned to Module A5. Environmental\
  \ effects caused by installation losses are not included in the LCA results, since\
  \ these depend on the construction project and thus vary. To calculate the additional\
  \ environmental burdens caused by the production and disposal of these installation\
  \ losses, the LCA results for a specific installation loss can be calculated (e.g.\
  \ installation loss 3%, multiplication of the LCA results by 1.03). Landfilling\
  \ with residual materials is assigned to Module C4. Credits based on the thermal\
  \ utilisation of the residual materials are assigned to Module D. 3.3 Estimates\
  \ and assumptions In the product system, external cullet or waste glass is used\
  \ as a neutral preliminary product within the framework of the LCA. This recycled\
  \ glass is regarded as a waste product and is therefore calculated as input without\
  \ loads. According to Pittsburgh Corning Europe NV, the average transportation distance\
  \ was defined as 350 km. 3.4 Cut-off criteria All operating data was taken into\
  \ consideration in the analysis. Processes whose entire contribution towards the\
  \ final manufacturing result in terms of mass and less than 1% were ignored. It\
  \ can be assumed that the processes ignored would each have contributed less than\
  \ 5 % to the impact categories under review. Machinery, plants and infrastructure\
  \ required in the manufacturing process were not considered. 3.5 Background data\
  \ \"GaBi 6\" - the software system for comprehensive analysis (GaBi 6) developed\
  \ by thinkstep AG - was used to model the FOAMGLAS\xAE life cycle. The data sets\
  \ contained in the GaBi data base are documented in the online GaBi documentation\
  \ (GaBi 6 Doku). The basic data in the GaBi data base was applied for energy, transport,\
  \ preliminary products and auxiliaries. No data records from other data bases were\
  \ used. The Life Cycle Assessment was drawn up for Belgium as a reference area.\
  \ This means that apart from the production processes under these marginal conditions,\
  \ the upstream stages also of relevance for Belgium such as provision of energy\
  \ carriers were used. Pittsburgh Corning Europe NV procures electricity from Norwegian\
  \ run-of-river power stations, for which the hydropower mix for 2009 was used. 3.6\
  \ Data quality All of the background data sets of relevance for the LCA were taken\
  \ from the GaBi 6 software data base. The background data used for the LCA was last\
  \ revised less than 4 years ago. 7 Environmental Product Declaration Pittsburgh\
  \ Corning Europe NV - FOAMGLAS\xAE F Pittsburgh Corning Europe NV supplied current\
  \ primary production data for 2013. This production data was examined for plausibility.\
  \ According to the manufacturer, there is very good representativity of the declared\
  \ product. The corresponding data sets were available in the data base for al preliminary\
  \ products used. The data quality can be regarded as very good. 3.7 Period under\
  \ review The data in this LCA are based on primary data on FOAMGLAS\xAE F production\
  \ in 2013 supplied by Pittsburgh Corning Europe NV. The volumes of raw materials,\
  \ energy, auxiliaries and consumables used are considered as average annual values.\
  \ 3.8 Allocation The plastic waste incurred is burned in a waste incineration p"
