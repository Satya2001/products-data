description: The rebar is used in the reinforcement of concrete in the construction
  industry. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an
  improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation
  dimensions are specified by ASTM standards A706 and A615. The rebar is shipped to
  various customers for rebar fabrication. Rebar is fabricated by cutting and bending
  operations to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. In accordance
  with the PCR, the declared unit and product density are shown in Table 1. Table
  1. Declared unit for reinforcing bar and the approximate density. Parameter Value
  Density 7,900 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT The steel rebar in this EPD contains 100% recycled
  steel scrap with an alloy content lower than 5%. In general, the reinforcing steel
  products will contain 95-99% recycled iron, including < 2% Manganese, < 1% Carbon,
  < 1.25% Chromium and a total of <2.25% Nickel and other alloying elements. Steel
  products under normal conditions do not present inhalation, ingestion, or contact
  health hazards. These products used inside the building envelope do not include
  materials or substances which have potential route of exposure to humans or flora/fauna
  in the environment.

  \ 14040, 14044, and ISO 21930. Scope of Results Reported: The PCR requirements limit\
  \ the scope of the LCA metrics such that the results exclude environmental and social\
  \ performance benchmarks and thresholds, and exclude impacts from the depletion\
  \ of natural resources, land use ecological impacts, ocean impacts related to greenhouse\
  \ gas emissions, risks from hazardous wastes and impacts linked to hazardous chemical\
  \ emissions. Accuracy of Results: Due to PCR constraints, this EPD provides estimations\
  \ of potential impacts that are inherently limited in terms of accuracy. Comparability:\
  \ The PCR this EPD was based on was not written to support comparative assertions.\
  \ EPDs based on different PCRs, or different calculation models, may not be comparable.\
  \ When attempting to compare EPDs or life cycle impacts of products from different\
  \ companies, the user should be aware of the uncertainty in the final results, due\
  \ to and not limited to, the practitioner\u2019s assumptions, the source of the\
  \ data used in the study, and the specifics of the product modeled. In accordance\
  \ with ISO 21930:2017, EPDs are comparable only if they comply with the core PCR,\
  \ use the same sub-category PCR where applicable, include all relevant information\
  \ modules and are based on equivalent scenarios with respect to the context of construction\
  \ works."
