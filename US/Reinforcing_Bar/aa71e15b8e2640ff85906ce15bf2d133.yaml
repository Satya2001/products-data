lca_discussion: '## Product Component Notes

  Steel bar products are manufactured entirely from carbon steel. They do not contain
  any materials or substances for which there exists a route to exposure that leads
  to humans or flora/fauna in the environment being exposed to said materials or substances
  at levels exceeding safe health thresholds. Manufacturing Nucor manufactures bar
  products from secondary steel (i.e., from steel scrap) via an electric arc furnace
  (EAF). Steel scrap is loaded into a refractory-lined vessel and melted via electric
  energy supplied through graphite electrodes. Oxy- fuel burners and other means of
  generating heat through chemical reactions are also employed. The chemistry of the
  molten steel is adjusted at this stage by adding material to attain a specific alloy
  composition and by removing impurities, which migrate to the slag. Once the desired
  chemical composition is attained, the molten steel is then cast into billets for
  eventual processing in the rolling mill located in the same facility. At the rolling
  mill, the billets are reheated in a natural gas furnace and run through rollers
  to shape their profile. Any steel scrap generated is recycled internally (i.e.,
  put back into the EAF). The finished products are packaged and loaded onto trucks
  for distribution to fabricators or job sites. Fabrication results are taken from
  the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) average EPD (CRSI, 2017). Figure
