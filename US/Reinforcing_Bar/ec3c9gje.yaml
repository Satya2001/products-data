description: "This EPD is for reinforcing bar fabricated by JD Steel Co., Inc.\u2019\
  s facility, located in Palmer, Alaska. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar\

  \ pat- tern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical\
  \ properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by ASTM standards\
  \ A615 and A706. Fabricated rebar is rebar that has been cut and bent as necessary\
  \ to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range\
  \ from #3 through #18. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product\
  \ density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing\
