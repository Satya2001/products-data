  \ to ISO 14025, 14040, 14044, and ISO 21930:2007. Scope of Results Reported: The\
  \ PCR requirements limit the scope of the LCA metrics such that the results exclude\
  \ environmental and social performance benchmarks and thresholds, and exclude impacts\
  \ from the depletion of natural resources, land use ecological impacts, ocean impacts\
  \ related to greenhouse gas emissions, risks from hazardous wastes and impacts linked\
  \ to hazardous chemi cal emissions. Accuracy of Results: Due to PCR constraints,\
  \ this EPD provides estimations of potential impacts that are inherently limited\
  \ in terms of accuracy. Comparability: The PCR this EPD was based on was not written\
  \ to support comparative assertions. EPDs based on different PCRs, or different\
  \ calculation models, may not be comparable. When attempting to compare EPDs or\
  \ life cycle impacts of products from different companies, the user should be aware\
  \ of the uncertainty in the final results, due to and not limited to, the practitioner\u2019\
  s assumptions, the source of the data used in the study, and the specifics of the\
  \ product modeled."
