lca_discussion: "*Italic text is default guidance and should be deleted before publication.\
  \  This field uses [Markdown formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)*\n\
  # Packaging\nPackaging for the steel framing products includes lumber, plastic banding\
  \ and metal banding.\n\n# Product Installation\n*A description of the type of processing,\
  \ machinery, tools, dust extraction equipment, auxiliary materials, etc. to be used\
  \ during installation shall be included. Information on industrial and environmental\
  \ protection may be included in this section. Any waste treatment included within\
  \ the system boundary of installation waste should be specified.*\n\n# Use Conditions\n\
  *Use-stage environmental impacts of flooring products during building operations\
  \ depend on product cleaning assumptions. Information on cleaning frequency and\
  \ cleaning products shall be provided based on the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\
  \ In the absence of primary data, cleaning assumptions shall be documented.*\n\n\
  # Re-Use\n*The possibilities of re-use, recycling and energy recovery shall be described.\
  \ If an Extended Producer Responsibility initiative such as a product take-back\
  \ program exists, this may be included.*\n\n# Disposal\n*The possible disposal channels\
  \ shall be indicated in accordance with disposal routes and waste classification.*\n\
  \n# Cut-Off Criteria\nThe cut-off criteria for including or excluding materials,\
  \ energy, and emissions data from the study are in accordance with the PCR and are\
  \ listed below.\n\nAll inputs and outputs to a unit process are included in the\
  \ LCA calculation for which data are available. Any data gaps are filled with representative\
  \ data. Assumptions used for filling data gaps are documented in the LCA report.\
  \ \n\nWhere there is a data gap or insufficient data, criteria for exclusion of\
  \ inputs and outputs is 1% of primary energy usage (renewable and non-renewable\
  \ energy) and 1% on a mass basis for the specific unit process. The maximum criteria\
  \ for exclusion of inputs and outputs is 5% of primary energy usage and mass across\
  \ all modules included in the LCA.\n\nIf a flow meets the above criteria for exclusion\
  \ but is considered to have a significant potential environmental impact, it is\
  \ included. \n\n\n# Allocation\nThis study follows the allocation guidelines of\
  \ ISO 14044 and allocation rules specified in the PCR and minimized the use of allocation\
  \ wherever possible. \n\nMass allocation was deemed the most accurate and reproducible\
  \ way of calculating the energy and material requirements for the manufacture of\
  \ steel framing product and its useful byproducts. Primary data for resource use\
  \ (e.g., electricity, natural gas, water), waste/byproducts, and emissions released,\
  \ are allocated on a mass-basis as a fraction of total annual production. \n\nThe\
  \ transportation from primary producer of material components to the CEMCO facilities\
  \ are based on primary data provided by CEMCO, including modes, distances, and amount\
  \ of steel transported. Transportation was allocated based on the mass and distance\
  \ the material was transported.\n\n\n# LCA Interpretation\nThe main contributions\
  \ to indicator results for the steel framing product are the Raw Material Extraction\
  \ and Processing (A1) stage, contributing 85-99% of the impact in most cases. \n\
  \n# Environment and Health during Manufacturing\n*Measures relating to environmental\
  \ and health protection during the product manufacturing process extending beyond\
  \ national guidelines (of the production country) may be described, e.g. reference\
  \ to a product safety data sheet (SDS), description of Environmental Management\
  \ Systems or similar, programs addressing air emissions, wastewater, noise, etc*\n\
  # Environment and Health during Installation\n*Information should be provided in\
  \ this section on the relationship between the product, the environment and health,\
  \ including possible harmful substances or emissions e.g. reference to a product\
  \ safety data sheet (SDS). Any recommendations concerning cleaning, maintenance,\
  \ etc. of the declared product should be listed in \u201CTechnical information on\
  \ scenarios\u201D.*\n# Extraordinary Effects - Fire, Water, Mechanical Destruction\n\
  ## FIRE\n*Information should be included on the product\u2019s fire performance\
  \ and possible impacts on the environment e.g. reaction-to-fire, other relevant\
  \ fire tests as applicable, and emissions to air.*\n\n## WATER\n*Information should\
  \ be included on the product\u2019s performance and possible impacts on the environment\
  \ following unforeseeable influence of water, e.g. flooding.*\n\n## MECHANICAL DESTRUCTION\n\
  *Information should be included on the product\u2019s performance and possible impacts\
  \ on the environment following unforeseeable mechanical destruction.*\n\n# Delayed\
  \ Emissions\n*If a manufacturer wishes to declare quantitative or qualitative information\
  \ on delayed emissions used to calculate Global Warming Potential within the EPD,\
  \ information may be provided here.*\n\n# Environmental Activities and Certifications\n\
  *Other environmental activities, such as participation in recycling or recovery\
  \ programs along with the details of these programs and contact information, may\
  \ be provided.\nFor certifications applied to the product and listed in the EPD,\
  \ a statement shall be included on where an interested party can find details of\
  \ the certification program.*"
