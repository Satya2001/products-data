  Table 3: Packaging Inputs Inputper sq. m WETS Unit Cardboard 0.2 kg Packaging waste
  disposal have been modeled as per guidelines in section 2.8.5 of Part A: Life Cycle
  Assessment Calculation Rules and Report Requirements. 11. PRODUCT INSTALLATION Product
  installation requirements and procedure are provided in guidelines by Tile Council
  of North America (TCNA). Mortar is used to adheretile to the floor substrate while
  grout is usedto fill in gaps betweenthetiles. 4.5% of waste is assumed for mortar
  and grout. Apart from these, installation solution made of acrylate and waterare
  also recommendedforinstallation. Installation inputs are detailed in Table 4. Table

  grout 4.5 % 4.5 % 12. USE CONDITIONS As recommendedbythe Tile Council of North America
  (TCNA), ceramictile floors are cleaned with dust mops daily and with a damp mop36
  times a year for commercial flooring applications. Damp moppingrequires the use
  of tap water for cleaning. The impacts from the mopsitself as multi-use tools are
  considered to be negligible per functional unit. Since the reference service life
  of porcelain tiles is 75 years, which is as long as the estimated service life of
  the building, there are no replacementsoftiles over the course ofthe lifetime of
  the building. Use phase conditions and inputs are provided in Tables 5 and 6 respectively.
  Table 5: Use Phase Parameters Cleaning Process Cleaning Frequency | QUIENMSoeAMD
  aea Dust mop 365 times/ year - Commercial Damp mop 36 times/ year (Commercial) Tap
  water Table 6: Use Phase Inputs Tap water 0.783 I/m2/yr 13. PRODUCT REFERENCE SERVICE
  AND BUILDING ESTIMATED SERVICE LIFE According to Part A: Life Cycle Assessment Calculation
  Rules and Report Requirements, UL Environment, V3.2, 2018, the Estimated Service
  Life (ESL) of the building is assumed to be 75 years. Since ceramic tiles are expected
  to last as long as the buildingitself, the Reference Service Life (RSL) of ceramictiles
  is taken to be 75 years. 14. DISPOSAL All waste has beenclassified according to
  regional-specific legislation as laid out in Section 2.8.6 in Part A: Life Cycle
  Assessment Calculation Rules and Report Requirements from UL Environment. Ceramic
  being a non-metal, all ofit is landfilled at end-of-life as per the aforementioned
  PCR. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT BACKGROUND INFORMATION 1. FUNCTIONAL UNIT The functional
  unit according to the PCR is 1 m? offinishedflooring. The function ofa floor covering
  is to cover andprotect the flooring substrate. Table 7: Functional Unit | reeey

  This EPDis considered a Cradle-to-Grave study. A summary of the life cycle modules
  included in this EPD is presented in Table


  ## Source Data Notes

  Primary data wascollected onsite by Fireclay associates. All calculation procedures
  adhere to ISO14044. Data collection forms were used to survey Fireclay of the materials
  inputs, energy inputs, waste outputs, and raw material supplier information as well
  as packaging inputs for the year 2019.'
