  \ renewable primary energy resources used as raw materials (RPRE). Since there are\
  \ no renewable energy resources used as raw materials, this parameter equals the\

  \ of the product, there are no renewable energy resources used as raw materials\
  \ in the product system. \u25AA Use of non-renewable primary energy excluding non-renewable\
  \ primary energy resources used as raw materials (NRPRE). While no classification\
  \ scheme is available in openLCA for energy resources used as raw materials, since\
  \ the non-renewable primary energy resources used as raw materials are negligible,\
