lca_discussion: '## Product Component Notes

  Structural steel sections are manufactured entirely from carbon steel. They do not
  contain any materials or substances for which there exists a route to exposure that
  leads to humans or flora/fauna in the environment being exposed to said materials
  or substances at levels exceeding safe health thresholds. Manufacturing Nucor manufactures
  structural sections from secondary steel (i.e., from steel scrap) via an electric
  arc furnace (EAF). Steel scrap is loaded into a refractory-lined vessel and melted
  via electric energy supplied through graphite electrodes. Oxy-fuel burners and other
  means of generating heat through chemical reactions are also employed. The chemistry
  of |3| Fabricated Hot-Rolled Structural Steel Sections Designated Steel Construction
  Product According to ISO 14025, EN 15804 and ISO 21930:2017 the molten steel is
  adjusted at this stage by adding material to attain a specific alloy composition
  and by removing impurities, which migrate to the slag. Once the desired chemical
  composition is attained, the molten steel is then cast into billets for eventual
  processing in the rolling mill located in the same facility. At the rolling mill,
  the billets are reheated in a natural gas furnace and run through rollers to shape
  their profile. Any steel scrap generated is recycled internally (i.e., put back
  into the EAF). The finished products are packaged and loaded onto trucks for distribution
  to fabricators or job sites. Fabrication results are taken from the American Institute
  of Steel Construction (AISC) average EPD (AISC, 2016). Figure 1: Flow chart for
  product system Transportation Transportation to the customer or construction site
